    <h2> Hudson's Bay Company </h2>
    <h2> Digital Product Intern, Summer 2019 </h2>

    <p>During the summer of 2019, I was able to work as a Digital Intern on the Checkout Product Team. HBC bannor companies include Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks OFF 5th, Lord & Taylor, and Hudson’s Bay, however, I focused primarily on collecting data for the Saks and Saks OFF 5th customer segments. Throughout the summer, I analyzed both qualitative and quantitative data to make recommendations in the form of two main deliverables. </p>

    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>

    <p>With the current system in place, HBC made decisions based on business requirements and numeric data. The customer, however, is forgotten in this process. I conducted customer research in the form of in-person interviews and unmoderated user testing to understand customer needs and preferences in regards to the checkout funnel and presented my findings, along with recommendations, to the head of UX. The in-line editing features I recommended within “cart” were decided to be a requirement for the next website iteration. </p>
    <p>By the end of the summer I conducted a total of 15 usability sessions, each testing a unique feature on competitor sites to understand user feedback.</p>

    <h2> Intern Presentation </h2>

    <p>I was tasked with finding creative ways to increase traffic to dot com. The main problem I identified is the extremely high return rate. Using Adobe Analytics and conducting an extensive competitive research to understand return figures, my team pitched an omnichannel approach to bridge this gap. The approach utilizes Augmented Reality features to target high returns and provide the customer with a store experience, online.</p>
